He did not know what his master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started too and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of the people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about half-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful contemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against the gun. “Will you fight?” she cried. “There is nothing to fight for,” he said; “nothing is lost.” Saying this he made a step towards her. “Will you fly?” she cried again. “There is no escape,” he said, stopping short, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes. “And you shall go?” she said slowly.</p></div> </div>
